## Problem statement: Finding the solution of impact of urban flooding in major cities

   Urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding as urbanization leads to developed catchments, which increases the flood peaks from 1.8 to 8 times and flood volumes by up to 6 times. Urban areas are densely populated and people living in vulnerable areas suffer due to flooding, sometimes resulting in loss of life. 
Improper disposal of solid waste, including domestic, commercial and industrial waste and dumping of construction debris into the drains also contributes significantly to reducing their capacities.The main objective of this problem is to help the city managers or urban residents in for predicting the impact of urban flooding and can help them to take preventive action.


## Functionalities:
1) The ability to predict the likelihood and potential severity of urban flooding in a given area.
2) Guidance on how individuals and communities can prepare for and respond to urban flooding.
3) Sharing and accessing real-time updates and alerts on urban flooding.
4) Registered user information and notify them in the event of flood occurence.
